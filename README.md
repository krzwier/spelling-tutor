# spelling-tutor

I have four school-age children, and studying spelling is not always a pleasant affair 😬. There is often frustration and sometimes even tears, and keeping all of the different spelling lists straight for each of them can be tricky.

I happened to be learning Javascript in a [Skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com/) course, and it occurred to me that I could practice my new skills while creating a web app for my kids to study their spelling lists.

The app grew and I added various easter eggs along the way, including gifs that display in response to certain user interactions (I fetched from the GIPHY API).  When I added a menu so that my kids could pick the voice that the computer used to read their spelling lists, spelling time turned into giggle time.  Our school year is now almost finished, but this app has seen lots of use.  Accordingly, it has benefitted from a lot of UI testing 😆.  The best part is that my kids are so proud that their mom created it 🦸‍♀️!  They even enjoy watching (and sometimes helping) when I update the code each week with their new spelling lists. Who knows--maybe I'm raising a new generation of coders!
